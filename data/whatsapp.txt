12/7/23, 9:37 AM - Aluta@Csc: Let me help you guys clarify ur thoughts. 
There’s was suppose to be a push for one of the course clashing on Friday. As it stands now we have two courses to attend to on Friday because of the clash. So Abdul was trying to let the MAT department push theirs back to Thursday morning for us but they are not really accepting it so he’s still working on it <This message was edited>
12/7/23, 9:37 AM - +233 20 785 2304: Tomorrow 6:30
12/7/23, 9:37 AM - +233 54 350 1001: Alright

12/24/23, 6:41 PM - Ucc Director: You guys can keep the data bundle okay...
I think this SRC don't want to give us this December's data bundle. 
1. They first came to apologize for the delay with some long essay filled with huge vocabularies with the intention to make us forget.
2. Instead of them to send the Data bundle too, they've deliberately extended the deadline for the update of numbers. The first deadline was last week Monday 18th Dec,... And now too, they've extended it to 26th.

How would one enjoy the package within 5 days to the end of the month??

They think they are wiser, they literally projected their corrupt governance out of "being too wise". <This message was edited>

12/24/23, 6:45 PM - Ucc Director: @233509604214 please do well to convey my comment to the source of the announcement.

I'll be counting on you please

Cos I can't bear it anymore, it's too much.
12/24/23, 6:49 PM - EKO@Ucc CITSA IT MEMBER: Let's exercise a little more patience. The SRC doesn't want to leave anyone out, which is why they keep extending the deadline.
12/24/23, 6:49 PM - EKO@Ucc CITSA IT MEMBER: Yes Sir
12/24/23, 6:54 PM - Ucc Director: C'mon Eko, patience for how long for the data bundle

I don't know what their intentions are, but the Big concern here is..

When is the December data bundle coming, and when are we going to use it... Today is 24th o.

The December data bundle's MONEY nu, we no go gree make e sink for free o.
12/24/23, 7:01 PM - EKO@Ucc CITSA IT MEMBER: 😂😂😂

12/24/23, 7:41 PM - +233 55 063 0272: The thing is, even if they extend it to 2050, still some people will not do. They should just credit the bundle to those who have done it and stop leaving people in suspense... If you don't release the bundle this month, they should double it for the next month. We will never let it go freee
12/24/23, 7:42 PM - EKO@Ucc CITSA IT MEMBER: Yes Sir

It's a high level language

Those range of cells, formulas we write, the pivot tables and the charts all take arguments and execute based on the instructions given.

12/26/23, 8:43 PM - Bismark@Csc: No, Excel itself is not a programming language. It is a spreadsheet software that uses formulas and functions for calculations. However, you can use Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) within Excel to create macros and automate tasks, effectively incorporating a programming aspect into Excel.

12/26/23, 8:47 PM - +233 55 237 3574: Get this right brother, Excel has some basic programming-like functionality in VBA, Excel itself is better described as a software application rather than a programming language. Its focus is spreadsheet tasks rather than general purpose coding.
12/26/23, 8:47 PM - Cindy @UCC Csc         : Pasco
12/26/23, 8:47 PM - Ucc Director: Without VBA and even the new Office script, it's still considered a programming language by many developers.

Most traditional programmers may consider it as not a language because it's not complex, and you don't write codes,...  But the reality is it's, language, a high level one
12/26/23, 8:47 PM - +233 53 674 0830: Which one too be VBA 😂

12/26/23, 8:48 PM - +233 53 494 0268: Okay, I side with you man, but High level language is a stretch man.
Maybe if it actually got a lambda integration and a few more tweaks yeah. But High level is crazy fr.
I meannn, it checks almost every box that a High level language is suppose to check but it's just so limited yk.
12/26/23, 8:49 PM - +233 50 501 3473: Visual Basic Application

12/26/23, 9:01 PM - Ucc Director: Goat text of all time on this platform!
12/26/23, 9:01 PM - James Shrt@ucc: Buh seriously @233550524030 @233534940268 excel can be considered a programming language so @233550524030 stop worrying us
12/26/23, 9:01 PM - +233 55 178 3814: Exactly💯😂
12/26/23, 9:01 PM - +233 50 501 3473: If you use it as a programming language
12/26/23, 9:01 PM - James Shrt@ucc: Naa he didn't say that why are you twisting it 😂
12/26/23, 9:02 PM - +233 53 494 0268: Sighhhh****
We get that these are applications softwares. But you don't want to accept that application softwares sometimes come with their own programming language. 
Forget VBA. Excel has enough syntax on its own to perform decent database and operations management tasks.
If it got a lambda integration and got some .net upgrades. It could've been one of the most popular programming languages. Chale this argument be shallow.
12/26/23, 9:02 PM - +233 53 494 0268: Yesss. Of fucking course.
12/26/23, 9:02 PM - James Shrt@ucc: Or @233550524030 do you want us to put it this way some programmers use Excel 😂

Your Mobile Money Account can be Emptied without an Alert.



Please let's be very careful.. There is a new HIGH TECH FRAUD in town called the SIM SWAP FRAUD, and hundreds of persons are already VICTIMS.

How does it work?

1 A new fraud called SIM SWAP has started.
Your phone network will momentarily go blind /zero (No Signal / Zero Bars) and after a while a call will come through.

2 The Person on the other end of the call will tell you that he is calling from (your cell phone
company) depending on your network and that there is a problem in your mobile network.

3 He will instruct you to Please press 1 on your
phone to get the network back.

🙏🏼Please at this stage don't Press anything, Just cut or END the call.
If you press 1, the network will appear suddenly and almost immediately go blind again (Zero Bars) and
by that action, your phone is #HACKED.

Within a second they will empty your bank
account, and you won't receive any alert.

What you will experience.
It will appear as though your line is without Network, meanwhile your SIM has been SWAPPED.

The danger here is that, you will not get
any alert of any transactions, so please those of us doing USSD Banking and Mobile Banking BEWARE.

Let's be very careful.

Please, forward to your contacts, loved ones
and friends. The fraud is increasing day by day.

Received from a #CybersecurityGroup
Don't forget to share this post......Many person's
Account have been emptied already!

The quality of the CITSA Lacoste ( the blue black) is far below belt. The UCC crest on it isn't visible and that doesn't speak well of the department.
Maybe others can also attest to what am trying to put across. I'm not generalizing it that CITSA Lacoste is of poor quality. I'm passing my judgement based on what I received

1/16/24, 10:09 PM - Ucc Director: Good evening Mr. Rep

We are in the university, we are grown ups, and we all know how things work here.

You can't just sit at the comfort of wherever you are ( you were) or find yourself and type any oblivious and incognizant text to the group okay.
I don't know when and how the so called meeting you went was made aware to you so I'll slow down.... But whatever be the case;

If you were pre-informed or aware a day or more before prior to the meeting then you are being unserious on your role hence backup.
However, if it was impromptu as it seems to be then, @ whoever called for the meeting should respect his position as "meeting organizer" and re-check his/her time management.

Why this comment??
Because we may have a lot of concerns, questions and serious issues which we might need to be addressed for us. 

Now check how many of us were online when you posted this?
And do you think you captured all our concerns with this off-the-cuff message??

Now that the meeting has ended... What happens with our grievances ??

To whom it may concern!!!

1/21/24, 10:36 PM - Ucc Director: Good evening fellow colleagues
I just came online, and have gone through over the messages (about 200+) one after the other.
The whole chat is a concern about what was posted in the announcement group... Especially on the dues and the form registration.

The fun aspect is, you guys are are not getting any answers to the concerns you've raised so far.

More funny part is: Anytime someone asks of the price of the dues to be paid ( or anything related ) @233509604214 and @233541549118 rushes to answer.... However, I have observed they've PRETENDED not to have seen the "What are they using the endorsement for?" , "Why only Computer Architecture class?"

Or they answered and I didn't see??🤷‍♂️

Anyways, we actually need explanation to that and it's very serious.

Program reps we need answers

1/22/24, 9:22 AM - Ucc Director: The manner you (@233541549118 ) sometimes respond to concerns is very appalling and disrespectful.
It's as if someone is disturbing or forcing you to do something.

You just throw tantrums, you also have poor communication skills, especially in dealing with things like this.
You better work on them, it'll help you.

Who does this? We ask for an explanation and you send a View Once screenshot.

And the annoying part is you don't even bother to ask for explanation on our behalf from the one gave you the orders.

You don't even regard us. <This message was edited>

1/22/24, 10:07 AM - Kwesi(CSc UCC DB): I believe as members of CITSA UCC we are entitled to know the semester’s(academic year) budget and how the funds gathered will be apportioned to the projects set by the department in conjunction with the executives. Not necessarily all the details but at least the main things the funds will be used for. It’s like we’re paying taxes, we have every right to know what our taxes are being used for and how they will in the long term benefit us. The dues are now being held as a prerequisite before we can “endorse our registration forms”, a phrase unfamiliar to me, and also we are expected to bring the endorsed forms to the Computer Architecture class. Why that class alone? Lastly, I did a little math and even if the L100s are over 300 and they are each to pay 100 cedis, that’s 30K cedis at minimum, plus L200s?, that’s a whole lot of money which we don’t know how it will be used. Also we need to be patient with our programme reps, they are literally our representatives, they are meant to carry our woes to those at the top, the way we are relating with them now is like they are the ones who made the decision.

1/22/24, 3:34 PM - Aluta@Csc: Good afternoon guys. 
Sorry to intrude and bash in. 
Well I would like to share something small that I have found out after reading all the messages here and also after making my enquiries. 

I spoke with the V. President about our concerns here on the dues. Well he said some of the lecturers will begin to demand for the endorsement of our registrations possibly and I asked if the dues was equally important as the sch fees and he said yes because that’s what they use to fuel the department.
1/22/24, 3:34 PM - Aluta@Csc: And I told him that we ain’t seeing any better fueling from the department so far and he said that was the orevious administration so they will try and do better now.  

And also when we get to l300 we will have to do an internship and it’s compulsory and necessary for our NSS placement or something like that and before we can have our internship letters endorsed we will need to pay all outstanding departmental dues before we will be endorsed. 

And note without an internship we are at a risk of having a delayed and a bad NSS endorsement letter from the department.
1/22/24, 3:34 PM - Aluta@Csc: So guys let’s just forget all this back and forth and let’s pay for the dues. 
And besides the dues it’s not expensive though 😂😂 25 cedis per semester so two semesters making 50 cedis no expensive u see 😂😂. 

My humbly advice sake of our NSS and a better and smooth internship next year coming forth let’s just go and pay for it and move on. If they cheat us now they will pay for sure somehow somewhere so guys let’s try and pay not by force though just a humbly and harmless advice to us all 
Thank you 🙏
1/22/24, 3:34 PM - Aluta@Csc: Please I’m not a rep, just a concern group member because the messages and insults are plenty that’s why I decided to ask for some clarification for us. 

You are free to ask questions I might have forgotten some of the stuffs he said maybe the questions will help me remember and share with us all

Thank You 🙏
1/22/24, 3:36 PM - Aluta@Csc: Take your time to read through them before you come and attack me please 😂😂😂 @233505013473 @233500129739 u hear me 😂😂

It's not only our department and there are departments that pay far more than what we pay even their continuing students more that our freshers. Some of you are talking about budget talks and stuff when even educational and fun programs held for you you don't even go and say the department does nothing with the dues.

And especially when most of the people complaining won't even participate in the various activities in the department to even hold them accountable. Let's be guided and nice you don't have to be rude all the time  Abdul is working for us and my best bet is if most of you were to be in his shoes you would have gone all ballistic like a dozen times even more than the claims you guys are saying that he has poor communication skills

I never complained about what the dues is being used for.
It's obvious, for running the association.

The major issue I requested an answer for was the endorsement of registration form. 
Secondly, why is it compulsory for only the Computer Architecture class?

This is what I asked.

Even still we do not know how the dept. fulfills these roles. 
None of this info was passed during our departmental orientation. To hear about it now just sounds like fear mongering. 
(I'm not saying don't pay your dues)

Isn't it strange to hear what your department does for you only when it's time to pay money? 🤔

1/29/24, 5:11 PM - Aziz Aziz@UCC Csc: ‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️ NOTICE!!! 

Information reaching us from EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) is that the current change in weather / atmosphere across the country is not harmattan, but rather an extreme form of air pollution with dire consequences on human health  

This can be hazardous and lead to :

1.	Reduced Lung function
2.	Respiratory infection
3.	Inflammation
4.	Oxidative Stress (low level of antioxidants which even creates an imbalance in your body)

Consequently, everyone is being advised to please :

-	Mask-up (wear nose mask)
-	Stay hydrated (Drink more water) preferably warm water.No to cold water
-	Cover food and water very well to prevent dust from settling on them.
-	Wash fruits very well before eating
-	Stay indoors as much as possible    

This condition may prevail for a considerable period of time.

Let’s take note, adhere strictly, keep our family and friends informed.

But we're also at fault tho
Honestly, we were told to be seated by 4pm so we start at 4:30pm but getting close to time and we (SWLT 16) weren't well placed for the quiz 
So we are the root cause actually
2/11/24, 2:05 PM - +233 55 867 1358: So if we did what we were supposed to do we wouldn't have gotten the female TA's reaction in the 1st place

3/12/24, 7:15 PM - Ucc Director: Dear Madrid fans

Hope this piece of texts finds you in good health.

I write to request for your support in our upcoming game against Napoli. I really need your support on this one. We may be rivals in Spanish football, but in Europe, especially in this difficult moment, I personally need your support for my team. Please don't do any *"against"* stuffs against us today. We are brothers back from the same home, let's do this together and rule European football together. Rivalry doesn't necessarily means we are enemies. Your support, no matter how much, is welcomed and appreciated. Let's win this 'Napoleon' fight together. 

Thank you.

Yours sincerely,
Vargas, 
An FC Barcelona fan from Ghana.

There is very limited internet nationwide, and those on Vodafone/Telecel have total outage.

1. WACS submarine cable break offshore and affecting MTN and Telecel completely.

2. Telecel owes heavily on SAT3 and have been disconnected hence total outage of telecel.

3. MTN is using their limited backup internet on MainOne cable hence able to provide limited Internet and priorizing corporate services.

1-The United States has confirmed that all countries in the world, in order to establish good relations with the great  powers, must accept same-sex marriage (woman/woman or man/man).    There are currently 34 countries where same-sex marriage is legal: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Denmark, Ecuador, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Uruguay.
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

2- Germany has just signed the law that declares that there is no more incest, that is to say: brother and sister can get married, mom and son, dad and daughter, etc. 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

3-The city of Miami is now proclaimed the city of purchase of public sex. That means: on the way, to church, 
at the mosque, at the market, at the football field, if you need sex you can enjoy it at any time without any problem.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

4-Canada has allowed bestiality (sex with animals) 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

5- In Spain: *pornographic films
are allowed in high school and universities.* 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

6- The authorization of the prostitution of minors is given. Marg Luker states that any young girl at the age of 10 who feels sexual pleasure,
no one should defend her from
find out how his body works.😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭

7- Finally the USA allowed the Satanic churches to be opened publicly.
Dear brothers and sisters, the end is near, the departure in Glory is approaching.
People are being distracted and the devil wants to drag the maximum number of souls with him in order to remove them from divine mercy. Let's be careful. 😭😭😭😭😭😭

If you have a minute...share this message. Why do we sleep in Churches, and stay awake in bars? Why is it so hard to talk about Jesus but so easy to gossip? 
Why is it so easy to ignore messages from God but send back dirty messages? 
🙏🙏🙏🙏
    May God bless you. Amen!!!
: SEXUAL IMMORALITY IS RAVAGING THE WORLD AT PRESENT.
 God Said: There will come a time when mankind will love five things and forget five things.*

 1. They will love the enjoyment of this world and forget the day of judgment.

 2. They will love money and forget the day of accountability of how they acquired and spent the money.

 3. They will fear things that are created and forget the creator.

 4. They will love beautiful mansions and forget their graves.

 5. They will love sins and forget to seek for God's forgiveness.

 Come to think of this?.......

 1. Eternal life = free
 2. Church entrance = free
 3. Christ's salvation = free
 4. God's love = free
 5. Breath of life = free

 A. Cigarette = pay
 B. Prostitution = pay
 C. Alcohol =pay
 D. Nightclub entrance fee = pay
 E. Powers to rule the world = pay

 Then why are people paying for hell while PARADISE is free?
 Think twice
 Believe in Christ and you shall be saved..
  We always think of Valentine's day
 Birth day
 Father's day
 Mother's day
 Children's day
 Farmer's day
 Teacher's day
 Christmas day
 Independence day
 Boxing day,
 This day,
 That day,
 Day in Day out.

 Have you ever thought of DEATH DAY and JUDGMENT DAY?  Is it going to be a day of celebration or condemnation for you?

 If you're safe, what about your friends & loved ones.  Show them love by telling them about the *DEATH DAY and JUDGEMENT DAY.*

  Please pass this to any group let heaven be happy for you today.  Please don't say later, do it now because tomorrow may be too late.
 Oh God, bless those who spread this message.
 Thank you God bless you❤️❤️

 *10* He came into the very world he created, but the world didn’t recognize him. 
 *11* He came to his own people, and even they rejected him. 
 *12* But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God. 
 *13* They are reborn—not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
[6] Yes, remember your Creator now while you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don’t wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well.
 [7] For then the dust will return to the earth, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.


[13] That’s the whole story. Here now is my final conclusion: Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone’s duty. 
[14] God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad.

Ecclesiastes was written by King Solomon and it talks about the life of Solomon, the mistakes he made, the lessons life taught him and his advice for generations after him. My favorite part is the *Chapter 12:13-14* which says..... Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone's duty ...... God will judge us for everything we do......
Amen 🔥🔥🔥

 [ *2* ] Don’t make rash promises, and don’t be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few.😍

 *A MATTER OF CONCERN!!!* 
I did a follow up to confirm my mark for computer Architecture quiz 3( the last quiz we wrote), that was after I received my assessment from the email they sent.
The TA told me they're still marking some scripts and for that matter I wouldn't be able to see my script. He added that I should wait for them to be through with the marking and afterwards the scripts will be distributed and I can then come if there are any corrections.
School goes down tomorrow and I haven't heard anything like the scripts are ready. I'm still waiting though, probably they'll share them tonight.
From what I know, I'm not the only one who went to the office  with same issue.
I don't think it's a crime seeing my script to confirm my mark.

4/20/24, 8:31 PM - Aziz Aziz@UCC Csc: @13135550002 what is plantain in twi ?
4/20/24, 8:31 PM - Meta AI: The word for plantain in Twi (a Ghanaian language) is "kontomire". However, it's possible that you might be referring to a specific type of plantain, as there are several words in Twi that can refer to different stages of ripeness or varieties of plantains. Here are a few more options:

- "Kutukuu" (unripe plantain)
- "Amkelewe" (ripe plantain)
- "Apuu" (overripe or soft plantain)

Let me know if you have any further questions!

4/29/24, 3:27 PM - Class Rep: Group members please give me your Attention because I have been observing something on this platform and it seems nobody is talking or everybody is doing eye service.
For me,I don't pretend, I say it the way it is but I am always careful not to insult anyone but I will definitely say the truth because for the fact that it has not gotten to you does not mean you won't talk about it and I owe nobody an apology because I need to say my mind. We all here are matured so we all need to know that today is 29th of APRIL ,2024 and that it is

Thank you so much for your time..

* *Happy Monday everyone

Good morning, family! I trust we are all doing well by God's grace. I want to encourage you all to seize this opportunity.

This Saturday, BITNOB is organizing a program called "Beyond Cape Coast". The program will cover entrepreneurship and cryptocurrency, and will include a giveaway of cryptocurrency and tutorial videos on how to trade crypto and earn more.

I know we have plans this Saturday, but I encourage you to set aside some time to attend. It promises to be a massive event with many prizes. Let's all come out in large numbers.

Be rest assured, Item 13 is massively guaranteed. Additionally, giveaways ranging from $1 to $100 are assured, so don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!

Who is Leroy, and what is the context in which you're referring to him? Additionally, the emoji you used suggests that Leroy might be a bit stubborn or frustrating to deal with? Please provide more information so I can better understand and assist you!
5/17/24, 5:28 PM - Meta AI: I'm glad I could bring a smile to your face! It sounds like you might be referencing a meme or a character named Leroy who is often depicted as stubborn or frustrating.

Good morning, family! I trust we are all doing well by God's grace. I want to encourage you all to seize this opportunity.

*Today*, BITNOB is organizing a program called "Beyond Cape Coast". The program will cover *ENTERPRENEURSHIP AND CRYPTOCURRENCY*, and will include a giveaway of cryptocurrency and tutorial videos on how to trade crypto and earn more.

I know we have plans today, but I encourage you to set aside some time to attend. It promises to be a massive event with many prizes. Let's all come out in large numbers.

Be rest assured, Item 13 is massively guaranteed. Additionally, giveaways ranging from $1 to $100 are assured, so don't miss out on this incredible opportunity!

5/30/24, 11:10 PM - +233 55 063 0272: A Fashion Designer and a UI/UX Designer are two distinct professionals with different areas of expertise:

Fashion Designer:

- Creates clothing, accessories, and footwear
- Focuses on aesthetics, texture, and functionality of physical products
- Sketches, prototypes, and produces garments, considering trends, materials, and comfort
- Works on runway shows, photoshoots, and brand collections

UI/UX Designer:

- Crafts user interfaces and user experiences for digital products
- Concentrates on usability, accessibility, and visual design for websites and applications
- Wireframes, prototypes, and tests digital interfaces, prioritizing user flow and interaction
- Ensures seamless interactions and intuitive navigation for digital users

Key differences:

- Physical products (fashion) vs. digital products (UI/UX)
- Aesthetics and functionality (fashion) vs. usability and accessibility (UI/UX)
- Runway shows and brand collections (fashion) vs. wireframes and user testing (UI/UX)

While both roles require creativity and attention to detail, they serve distinct purposes and require different skill sets.
5/30/24, 11:13 PM - EKO@Ucc CITSA IT MEMBER: So you see the difference?
5/30/24, 11:13 PM - +233 55 063 0272: Very Clear

You have to take that flyer down ASAP!

The Lecturer himself came to the afternoon class and informed us to discuss a suitable time for online class cos he couldn't meet us that day.
He lasted less than 5mins. So where from the assignment we're being forced to do?

The assignment is for those he taught in the morning.
Period!

6/13/24, 6:08 AM - Kwesi(CSc UCC DB): It honestly makes no sense, they know very we have other classes in between the time they give us but still give us the assignment. For what exactly?
The purpose for an assignment is to help us understand what we are learning in class through our careful research and teamwork, but here’s the case you give an assignment and give a short space of time. Obviously the whole point of the assignment breaks down since now, people will just use AI, copy each other, and submit the assignment for you. To them, they are trying to make us serious, but what they’re actually doing is making us lazy and reducing our critical thinking skills. Ah well, abi they’re being paid, they have to “stress” us by any means.

6/14/24, 6:48 AM - +233 50 278 0546: It's high time we tell the department about our tragic moments with some lecturers, computer science students submitting assignment in this massive rainy period where flood all over and lateness is not entertained
We're not against the fact that we're to submit assignments in hard copy form,but the problem is the unfavorable atmospheric conditions on spot
6/14/24, 6:48 AM - +233 50 278 0546: My humble plea course reps,try and do something about such things

6/14/24, 7:01 AM - +233 26 453 0302: Good morning please 
I think your suggestion is cool but also think about this,was your programming technique results worth what you wrote please?
Because for me and others that I know,we didn't deserve what we got but it came out good.
I think all these assignments and stress they put us through counts for them to give us the good grade we see in our portal
I'm positive architecture will be same even after getting bad assessments, I don't even think someone will get D

6/14/24, 7:02 AM - +233 26 453 0302: We won't meet him again after this semester so I think we should endure and get the good grade we need and move🙏

6/14/24, 7:05 AM - +233 55 867 1358: There were probably those who actually couldn't step out to go buy the official paper to actually start the work
6/14/24, 7:06 AM - +233 26 453 0302: I understand.  I stay around apewosika so I experienced that too, even till now,the big gutter is still flooded but ah well...🤷‍♂️
6/14/24, 7:06 AM - +233 55 867 1358: Me for example, as a mere mortal as I am
I was competing with vehicles for space to move due to flood
Funny thing is the space itself kraa was something really small

6/14/24, 7:07 AM - +233 50 278 0546: They didn't consider all those problems, is this wickedness or what

6/14/24, 7:09 AM - Ilt Rep UCC Csc: We are not saying giving an assignment is a bad thing to do but the time of submission is very bad..Let’s take last week’s where we were supposed to submit it online, we were here waiting for link for about 2 hrs no link the moment the link came naa he closed it again we have to complain for him to bring it back howw..Yesterday some of us from has to swim through this flood before submitting this assignment where I even got to buy the official paper dier I don’t want to talk about it
6/14/24, 7:09 AM - +233 55 867 1358: In fact when I got to the flooded area at Ayensu everyone else had stopped and were returning to their hostel ooo
They're all even taller than me but due to this assignment I became Moses and Okomfo Anokyi combined doing signs and wonders passing through the flood
I had to put pride aside 
By now those crushing on me in the area nu it has pass their eye top
I turn RAINBOW COLORS that

6/16/24, 9:52 PM - +233 55 231 2335: WHY MEN ARE IMPORTANT ??

1. You can't spell (Madam)
      without the (Adam)in it

2. Neither can you spell (Woman) 
       without the (Man)
 
3. You also can not spell (female)
       without the (Male)

4. Nor spell (She)
      without the (He)

5. You most definitely can not spell (Mrs)
      without the (Mr)
6. When a woman is seeing her monthly flow, it's called MENstration (men)

7. When she's old and doesn't see her monthly flow, it's called MENopause (men)... 

8. and finally, in prayers, we continue to say (Amen) 
        and not (A-women)...

Dedicated to All Wonderful MEN😄Respect Men🙏

Happy Father's Day to all men on this platform.✍️✍️✍️.

Maybe we may not even see each other again after  our degree.  What I am striking at is our wickedness towards each other in the quizzes and exams. You will ask someone a question, and the person will just look at you and turn back his/her head without even a word.  Is not fair. We aren't in the SHS where we do competition. Please let's work on that.🙏🙏 @233541549118  @233593846111 <This message was edited>

8/3/24, 4:41 PM - Kwesi(CSc UCC DB): The last class for example, you yourself you came in late, as soon as you came, you asked for the door to be closed and attendance to be taken. There was absolutely no need for that, you were in the wrong by coming late yourself and you still want to met out disciplinary actions for coming 45 seconds earlier than the students.

8/3/24, 4:42 PM - +233 53 494 0268: True. We have to be very tactical about this. Else, in an attempt to elevate our score, we could spite them and cause our own harm.

8/3/24, 4:42 PM - +233 53 494 0268: See this is it. Jigga, they've already established the fact that they're in to mafia. It's all about trying to settle this calmly. We complaining isn't going to bring anything good.
8/3/24, 4:43 PM - Ram: Let’s Appeal to pity💀
8/3/24, 4:43 PM - Kwesi(CSc UCC DB): It has to be personal, if he was actually being fair with us regarding how things were conducted in class, there would be no need for me to take it personal.
Can’t you see when someone has an agenda?
How can you be actively mafia’ing and smiling simultaneously??
8/3/24, 4:44 PM - +233 59 384 6111: Yes, you've said it all. Let's take heart and present our petition in a polite manner 🙏🏾
8/3/24, 4:44 PM - +233 53 494 0268: Cause if I'm being honest, I only attended the 6:30 class for attendance. There was nothing new to learn. This isn't that time to start complaint. Let's plan this shi well and up our grades. 🙏🏿
8/3/24, 4:44 PM - +233 54 145 9868: Well start the plan
8/3/24, 4:45 PM - Kwesi(CSc UCC DB): I’ve not been on impolite though

8/4/24, 11:05 AM - Meta AI: In the context of operating systems, a deadlock is a situation where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release a resource. This creates a cycle of dependencies, causing all involved processes to be blocked indefinitely.

Here's a more detailed explanation:

- Two or more processes are competing for shared resources (e.g., memory, I/O devices, or files).
- Each process holds a resource and waits for another resource held by another process.
- No process can proceed because it's waiting for a resource held by another process, which is also waiting for a resource held by the first process.

The necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur are:

1. *Mutual Exclusion*: Two or more processes require exclusive access to a common resource.
2. *Hold and Wait*: A process holds a resource and waits for another resource.
3. *No Preemption*: The operating system cannot force a process to release a resource.
4. *Circular Wait*: The waiting processes form a circular chain, where each process waits for a resource held by the next process in the chain.

Deadlocks can be prevented or resolved using various techniques, such as:

- Resource ordering
- Avoiding nested locks
- Using timeouts
- Detecting and aborting deadlocks
- Using deadlock avoidance algorithms (e.g., Banker's algorithm)

8/4/24, 11:13 AM - 𝗕𝗥𝗨𝗖𝗘 Csc💫✨: @13135550002 what is paging
8/4/24, 11:13 AM - Meta AI: Paging is a memory management technique used by operating systems to enable efficient use of physical memory (RAM). It allows a process to use more memory than is physically available by dividing the process's address space into smaller, fixed-size blocks called pages.

Here's how paging works:

1. *Page Table*: The operating system creates a page table for each process, which maps virtual pages to physical frames (blocks of RAM).
2. *Page Fault*: When a process accesses a page that is not in physical memory, a page fault occurs.
3. *Page Replacement*: The operating system finds an empty frame in physical memory and reads the required page from disk storage (e.g., hard drive or SSD).
4. *Page Swapping*: If no empty frames are available, the operating system swaps out an existing page from physical memory to make room for the new page.

Paging offers several benefits:

- *Efficient Memory Use*: Processes can use more memory than is physically available.
- *Memory Protection*: Each process has its own page table, preventing access to other processes' memory.
- *Reduced Memory Fragmentation*: Pages can be allocated and deallocated efficiently, reducing memory fragmentation.

However, paging also has some overhead:

- *Page Faults*: Page faults can lead to increased execution time and decreased performance.
- *Page Replacement*: Finding an empty frame or swapping out a page can be time-consuming.

To mitigate these issues, operating systems use various paging algorithms, such as:

- *First-In-First-Out (FIFO)*: Replaces the oldest page in physical memory.
- *Least Recently Used (LRU)*: Replaces the page that has not been accessed for the longest time.
- *Optimal*: Replaces the page that will not be needed for the longest time.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

8/4/24, 11:14 AM - 𝗕𝗥𝗨𝗖𝗘 Csc💫✨: @13135550002 how does it relate to fragmentation
8/4/24, 11:14 AM - James Shrt@ucc: U no go do mcq question u dey do what is paging @233241144988
8/4/24, 11:14 AM - Meta AI: Paging helps to reduce memory fragmentation, which occurs when free memory is broken into small, non-contiguous blocks, making it difficult to allocate large contiguous blocks of memory.

Here's how paging relates to fragmentation:

1. _External Fragmentation_: In a non-paged system, free memory is broken into small blocks, making it hard to allocate large contiguous blocks. Paging solves this by dividing memory into fixed-size pages, allowing for more efficient use of free memory.
2. _Internal Fragmentation_: In a paged system, each page is allocated a fixed amount of memory, which can lead to internal fragmentation (wasted space within a page). However, paging algorithms like paging with offset or segmentation can help reduce internal fragmentation.

Paging benefits:

- _Reduced External Fragmentation_: Pages can be allocated and deallocated efficiently, reducing fragmentation.
- _Improved Memory Utilization_: Pages can be used more efficiently, reducing wasted space.

However, paging can also introduce some fragmentation:

- _Page Table Fragmentation_: Page tables can become fragmented, leading to wasted space.
- _Page Frame Fragmentation_: Page frames can become fragmented, leading to wasted space.

To mitigate these issues, operating systems use techniques like:

- _Page Table Compaction_: Compacting page tables to reduce fragmentation.
- _Page Frame Reuse_: Reusing page frames to reduce fragmentation.
- _Paging Algorithms_: Using algorithms like LRU or Optimal to reduce fragmentation.

In summary, paging helps reduce memory fragmentation by dividing memory into fixed-size pages, allowing for more efficient use of free memory. However, paging can also introduce some fragmentation, which can be mitigated using various techniques.

8/4/24, 11:18 AM - +233 55 685 2123: @13135550002 what is semaphore?
8/4/24, 11:19 AM - Zak CS: @13135550002 wokwasia😂😂💔
8/4/24, 11:18 AM - Meta AI: A semaphore is a variable or abstract data type that provides a simple but powerful mechanism for controlling access to shared resources in a parallel programming or concurrent system by multiple processes or threads. It is a basic building block for more complex synchronization primitives.

A semaphore has a integer value that can be incremented or decremented. The value of the semaphore determines the number of processes or threads that can access the shared resource. If the value is positive, then that many processes or threads can access the resource. If the value is zero, then no processes or threads can access the resource.

There are two main types of semaphores:

1. *Binary Semaphore*: Can take only two values, 0 or 1. It is used to protect a single shared resource.
2. *Counting Semaphore*: Can take any integer value. It is used to protect multiple instances of a shared resource.

Semaphores are used to solve the critical section problem, where multiple processes or threads need to access a shared resource, but only one can access it at a time.

Some common operations performed on semaphores include:

- *Wait* (P): Decrement the semaphore value. If the value is zero, then the process or thread will block until the value becomes positive.
- *Signal* (V): Increment the semaphore value. If there are blocked processes or threads, then one of them will be unblocked.
- *TryWait*: Decrement the semaphore value if it is positive, but do not block if the value is zero.

Semaphores are widely used in operating systems, networking, and database systems to manage access to shared resources.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

8/6/24, 8:36 AM - Zak CS: @13135550002 help a brother 🥲
8/6/24, 8:36 AM - Zak CS: @13135550002 Assume there are pointers F for front and R for rear respectively pointing into sequential memory What is the represcntalion(in a diagram) for
i. empty queue.
ii. full queue.
in partially full queue

8/6/24, 8:37 AM - +233 54 105 7095: null
8/6/24, 8:37 AM - Meta AI: No worries, my friend! Let me try again with a diagram:
```
  i. Empty Queue
  F --> |   |   |   |
  R --> |   |   |   |

  ii. Full Queue
  F --> | 1 | 2 | ... | n |
  R --> | 1 | 2 | ... | n |

  iii. Partially Full Queue
  F --> | 1 | 2 | ... | k |   | ... |   |
  R --> | 1 | 2 | ... | k |   | ... |   |
```
In this diagram:

- `| |` represents an empty space
- `F -->` points to the front of the queue
- `R -->` points to the rear of the queue
- `1`, `2`, ..., `n` represent elements in the queue

Does this visual representation help clarify things?
8/6/24, 8:36 AM - Meta AI: Here are the representations:

*i. Empty Queue*

F → NULL
R → NULL

[No elements in the queue]

*ii. Full Queue*

F → [Element 1]
[Element 2]
...
[Element n]
R → [Element n]

[All memory locations are filled, F points to the first element, and R points to the last element]

*iii. Partially Full Queue*

F → [Element 1]
[Element 2]
...
[Element k]
[Empty]
...
[Empty]
R → [Element k]

[F points to the first element, R points to the last element, and there are empty spaces after the last element]

Note: The "→" symbol represents the pointer direction.

Please let me know if you'd like me to clarify or elaborate!
8/6/24, 8:36 AM - Meta AI: No worries! I understand it can be a bit tricky to visualize. Let me try again with a simpler representation:

_i. Empty Queue_

F = R = 0

[No elements]

_ii. Full Queue_

F = 1, R = n

[Elements from 1 to n, no empty spaces]

_iii. Partially Full Queue_

F = 1, R = k

[Elements from 1 to k, empty spaces from k+1 to n]

Think of it like a line of people:

- Empty: No one in line
- Full: The line is complete, no empty spaces
- Partially Full: Some people in line, with empty spaces at the end

Does this help?
8/6/24, 8:36 AM - Meta AI: No worries, my friend! I'm here to help. What do you need assistance with? Do you have more questions about Operating Systems, or is it something else entirely? Let me know, and I'll do my best to help a brother out!

When you attend all the practicals and you are submitting a write-up late, they'll treat you like garbage and tell you they won't take it.

8/9/24, 11:35 PM - Ucc Director: So what I'm trying to prove is this:

They know one can come and do the experiment at anytime later so why do they stress those who attend all sessions when submitting a write-up late?

Even given the opportunity of letting others do theirs later is unfair for those who attended all the sessions *with regards to* some of the treatments such as getting sacked when late and staying behind closed door, deduction of marks because of no submission, sacking you from the lab when you are not done.

Such things don't promote equality, it's not fair, it doesn't reflect the essence of attending the practical session.

Simply put, It's doesn't make sense.
8/9/24, 11:35 PM - +233 24 111 6109: Oga Commot for there
8/9/24, 11:37 PM - +233 24 111 6109: na joke oo
Don’t write a whole book about me, please
8/9/24, 11:37 PM - Ucc Director: Last year, after doing all the experiment, they called me later to pay and amount before they give me marks for the assessment else I'll get IC.

So then what's the essence of you attending the practicals??
8/9/24, 11:37 PM - Ucc Director: Waaa see this
